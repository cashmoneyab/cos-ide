# cos-ide
cos ide is the literal definition of "script box", this is bulit, tested, and optimized to the FULLEST, and FULLY customizable. 
**

this is a remake of a remake, I lost BOTH files (im a generation fubbler), anyway.
I decided to Remake the remake of the remake, by making it so fast and so reliable, you literally WOULD WANT to pay for this.
At this rate, its free, the reason is, i'm tired of seeing these trash "syntax highlighters", they are literally just token highlighers with trash colors. 
the last remake of this project had the following

        property and function highlighting
        autofill for keywords and globals
        identation and MORE autofill
        and a damn fast lexer (6000 tokens per second).

understand this, i'm running all of this on a computer that could go toe to toe with a boosted windows 95 and would after 93 rounds
still have a draw.
if it fast on this computer, its fast on urs sugarplum <3.
